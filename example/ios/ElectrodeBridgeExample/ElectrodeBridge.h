/**
 ElectrodeBridge is responsible for dispatching and handling both events and 
 requests between React Native and iOS platforms. It allows native to native, 
 React Native to React Native, React Native to native and native to React Native 
 messaging to create a simplified way of communication between the two and 
 native components.
 
 Events are simple fire and forget, while requests require a response of sort. 
 Requests also have a timeout.
