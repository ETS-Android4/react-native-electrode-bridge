Electrode React Native Bridge Demo App
--------------------------------------

This is the demo/test app of the electrode react native bridge.  
The UI of this demo app is divided in two halves :

- The `top half` of the screen contains the `Native App`.
- The `bottom half` of the screen is the `React Native App`.

Yes, there is actually a native app and a react native app running at the same time on the same screen. This is the easiest way to actually exchange messages while allowing one to see messages being exchanged.

#### If you want to run it yourself

Git clone this repo, then :

```shell
> npm install
> react-native run-android
```

#### If you don't really care about running it yourself ...

... Here is what it looks like (I'm sure you can tell UI was designed by a developer !)
